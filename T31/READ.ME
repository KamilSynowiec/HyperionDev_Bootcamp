this is a higher-order function simulating how filter built-in method works.

It takes 2 arguments: 
- array of strings with 10 words where at least 3 of the words have 6 letters
- callback function that returns a boolean based on whether or not a word has 6 letters

It returns a new array that contains only the words that are 6 letters long
